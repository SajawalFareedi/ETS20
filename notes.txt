IDEA:
    Develop a bot which will buy newly launched tokens on Uniswap and sell them with 3x profit.

REQUIREMENTS:
    Flashbots RPC
    Token Sniffer API   - 90% Weight
    Quick Intel API     - 60% Weight
    GoPlus API          - 80% Weight

DEV LOGIC:
    Connect with the RPC and monitor new Events on Uniswap smart contract. If there's any launch event then get the tokens from it and Scan that token using Token Scanners. If the token is safe then send requests to RPC for buying that token worth $50 and set a fees of $20 MAX. Once the token's price goes up, 3x at least, then quickly send the selling requests and sell it. There will be taxes on buying/selling. Make sure they are less than 10% while buying/selling.

    Buy the token and start scaning it after that. Repeat the scans until you get the real result and take an action based on result. Actions:
        
        Tax Modifiable -> sell
        Liquidity not locked -> sell
        Creator or Owner has very large chunk of tokens -> sell
        Rest -> Hold until 5x
